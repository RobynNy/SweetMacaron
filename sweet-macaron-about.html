		    In the year of 2014, Mary Clark and her sister Valentine Clark decided to create Sweet Macaron after their parents, 
            who were French bakers in Paris. They wanted to portray their love in the macaron like their parents did 
		    In 2014, they opened up their first bakery in Irvine, California.
		 </p>
         <p class = "about-bottom">		 
            Sweet Macaron started out with limited flavors but grew exponentially, which resulted in 
            two more stores opening in 2016. One is located in Los Angeles, California and the other in San Diego, California.
		 </p>
         <p class = "about-bottom" id = "bottom-p-about">		 
		    Sweet Macaron places high value in community, in quality products 
            and uses as many local providers for their ingredients to make 
			their delicate macarons. Quality over quantity is their motto.
