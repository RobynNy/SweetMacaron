         <p id = "about_top">Doux Macaron (&#8220;Doux&#8221; means sweet in French) is a macaron bakery based in California. 
                             In the year of 2014, Mary Clark and her sister Valentine Clark decided to create Doux Macaron after their parents, 
                             who were French bakers in Paris. They wanted to portray their love in the macaron like their parents did 
				             In 2014, they opened up their first bakery in Irvine, California. 
                             Doux Macaron started out with limited flavors but grew exponentially, which resulted in 
							 two more stores opening in 2016. One is located in Los Angeles, California and the other in San Diego, California.
